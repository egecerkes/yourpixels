# Code of conduct

## History

A Code of Conduct (hereafter: **“CoC”**) is nowadays demanded by a variety of actors, institutions and corporations. It sets basic rules and guidelines for a community and its contributors to follow and consequences in case of a violation.
In order to avoid any future confusion or discussion about it, the founder of pixelplanet took an active stance, considered multiple options and created this document.

This CoC is derived from the [SQLite Code of Ethics](https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html).

## The Rule

1. Don't say anything racist to people except Azerbaijanis.
2. Don't mock peoples belief.
3. Respect every ideology.
4. No transphobism in game chat.
